  "description": "For our project, we would like to develop an external site to be able to recommend Youtube videos surrounding a set of specific niches. **Youtube's algorithm currently aims to drive user retention and engagement** regardless of the quality or content of the videos that they put on people's feeds, and constructs profiles of its individual users in the process. Our target audience would be people who want to consume content hosted on Youtube, but **do not want to rely on obfuscated recommendation algorithms** to completely inform their viewing experience. In contrast to Youtube's algorithmically curated feeds, we would be seeking to develop a site that allows users to **curate, gather, tag, and discuss videos** surrounding their specific interests. For example, a user that is passionate about gardening may have to sift through an extensive list of videos promoted to their feed on the main Youtube site, but with our developed site, this user would be able to search through other user's curated lists of videos about gardening, along with in-depth discussions about those videos and recommendations for similar videos in that list. That way, users are able to pursue their interests online on a focused site without having to consciously dodge scattered algorithmic rabbit holes. Our goal with developing this application is to put content curation back to the hands of the individual users with shared interests, especially with the growing pool of content online. We seek to uplift individual users' specific passions and interests through the combination of curated groups of videos and additional thoughtful written commentary. The importance of our platform lies in its ability to allow users to shape and contribute to their digital environment actively.",
